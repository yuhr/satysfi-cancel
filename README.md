# satysfi-cancel

The SATySFi equivalent of the LateX's cancel package.

## Usage

It's pretty straightforward to use. This package contains just two inline math constructs; `\cancel` and `\xcancel`.

```satysfi
\cancel{S}
\xcancel{Sein}
```

Check out [demo](tests/cancel.pdf).

Currently the thickness and color of bars are both hardcoded.
