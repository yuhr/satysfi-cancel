# satysfi-cancel

SATySFi equivalent package of LaTeX's `cancel` package.

## Usage

It's pretty straightforward to use. This package contains just two inline math constructs; `\cancel` and `\xcancel`.

```satysfi
\cancel{S}
\xcancel{Sein}
```

Currently the thickness and color of bars are both hardcoded.
